### About the Experiment 

Cogging is a metalworking process used to improve the grains of a piece of metal. It is a hot metal forging technique involving two dies with shaped surfaces. The term "cogging" come from the fact that the metal is meant to be pressed into the shape of the die in the same way two cogs will fit into each other, though the shape of the die is not always rectangular.
