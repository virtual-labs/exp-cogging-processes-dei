    {
      "question": "In the video shown in the cogging module, the material is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Steel",
        "b": "Aluminium",
        "c": "Copper",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Steel is commonly used in cogging demonstrations due to its high-temperature workability.",
        "b": "Aluminium is forgeable but was not used in the given simulation.",
        "c": "Copper is used in forming, but not in this module’s demonstration.",
        "d": "Incorrect because steel was used."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a"
    },
    {
      "question": "The press used in the simulation of cogging operation is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Hydraulic press",
        "b": "Screw press",
        "c": "Mechanical press",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cogging requires controlled, slow, and high-force compression—hydraulic presses are ideal for this.",
        "b": "Screw presses deliver impact, not slow continuous pressure.",
        "c": "Mechanical presses are used for high-speed operations, unsuitable for cogging.",
        "d": "Incorrect because hydraulic press was used."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a"
    },
    {
      "question": "The temperature of the billet used in the simulation of cogging process is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "25° C",
        "b": "100° C",
        "c": "1100° C",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cold cogging is impractical as the forces required would be extremely high.",
        "b": "100°C is far below forging temperature for steel.",
        "c": "Steel is typically cogged at 1100–1250°C, making this the correct hot-working temperature.",
        "d": "Incorrect as 1100°C matches standard forging temperature."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c"
    },
    {
      "question": "The number of passes used to convert round billet into square billet in cogging process simulation are:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "2",
        "b": "3",
        "c": "4",
        "d": "8"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Two passes are insufficient to obtain a square section from a round billet.",
        "b": "Three passes still do not generate a fully square shape.",
        "c": "Four passes (with 90° rotations) are standard to convert round to square.",
        "d": "Eight passes would be excessive for a simple square section."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following material cannot be cogged:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Steel",
        "b": "Aluminium",
        "c": "Lead",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Steel is widely cogged at high temperature.",
        "b": "Aluminium can be cogged easily due to good ductility.",
        "c": "Lead is soft and can undergo plastic deformation, so it can also be cogged.",
        "d": "All listed materials are forgeable and can be cogged, so none of them is excluded."

      "correctAnswer": "d"
