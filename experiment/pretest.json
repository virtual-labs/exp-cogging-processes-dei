    {
      "question": "Q1. The purpose of cogging operation is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To reduce the cross-section of the billet",
        "b": "To increase the length of the billet",
        "c": "To improve the grain structure",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cogging reduces the cross-sectional area by repeated compressive blows.",
        "b": "As the cross-section reduces, the billet elongates along its length.",
        "c": "Hot working during cogging breaks down coarse grains and improves internal grain structure.",
        "d": "Cogging simultaneously reduces cross-section, increases length, and refines grain structure—hence all statements are correct."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d"
      
    },
    {
      "question": "Q2. Which of the following shaped billet can be produced by the cogging operation:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Round shape",
        "b": "Rectangular",
        "c": "Hexagonal",
        "d": "All of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Round billets can be formed by controlling die geometry during cogging.",
        "b": "Rectangular or square sections are commonly produced from ingots through cogging passes.",
        "c": "By sequential compression at angles, polygonal sections like hexagon can be produced.",
        "d": "Cogging can generate a wide range of cross-sectional shapes depending on pass schedule and die setup."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d"
    },
    {
      "question": "Q3. What is the advantage of cogging operation:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Internal grain structure is improved",
        "b": "Size of the billet can be reduced",
        "c": "Different cross-section shape can be achieved",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cogging is a hot-working process that breaks dendritic grains and improves mechanical properties.",
        "b": "Repeated deformation reduces the billet’s cross-sectional dimension.",
        "c": "Various shapes can be achieved through controlled sequencing of blows and rotations.",
        "d": "Cogging provides all these benefits—grain refinement, dimensional reduction, and shape modification."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d"
    },
    {
      "question": "Q4. The cogging is done at which stage of the metal forming process:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Initial stage",
        "b": "Intermediate stage",
        "c": "At the end",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cogging is the first breakdown operation performed on cast ingots to convert them into workable billets.",
        "b": "Intermediate processing involves rolling or forging, not cogging.",
        "c": "Finishing processes happen after primary breakdown; cogging is not one of them.",
        "d": "Incorrect because cogging is clearly a primary breakdown step."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a"
    },
    {
      "question": "Q5. By cogging operation the ingot is converted into:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Billet",
        "b": "Slab",
        "c": "Bloom",
        "d": "Sheet"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cogging is specifically used to convert large cast ingots into billets for further processing.",
        "b": "Slabs are formed mainly by rolling, not cogging.",
        "c": "Blooms are larger cross-sections; cogging usually aims at billets (smaller).",
        "d": "Sheets are produced by rolling, not by cogging."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a"
